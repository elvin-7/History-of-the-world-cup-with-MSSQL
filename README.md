## Introduction
In preparation for the 2022 FIFA men's world cup, I decided put my new found SQL skills to the test by querying a kaggle dataset on [all international football games from 1872 to date](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017) to help tell a story about the history of the FIFA World Cup.

In this repository, you will be reading about some of the interesting facts I discovered while playing with the dataset. Hope you enjoy it ðŸ˜„.
The written codes can be found [here](https://github.com/elvin-7/History-of-the-world-cup-with-MSSQL/blob/main/World%20Cup%20Project.sql)
